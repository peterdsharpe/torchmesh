"""Neighbor and adjacency computation for simplicial meshes.

This module provides GPU-compatible functions for computing various adjacency
relationships in simplicial meshes, including point-to-cells, point-to-points,
and cell-to-cells adjacency.

All adjacency relationships are returned as Adjacency tensorclass objects using
offset-indices encoding for efficient representation of ragged arrays.
